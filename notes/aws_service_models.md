# Day 2 - AWS Service Models & Deployment Models

## IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
- Provides only the underlying infrastructure: servers, storage, network.
- You manage software, middleware, apps; cloud handles the hardware.
- Example: Hosting a website using EC2 instances without owning physical servers.

## PaaS (Platform as a Service)
- Cloud provides infrastructure + middleware/platform.
- You provide your application; cloud handles OS, networking, runtime.
- Example: Deploying a web app on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

## SaaS (Software as a Service)
- Cloud provider manages everything: infrastructure, platform, and software.
- You only use the application.
- Example: Gmail, Slack, Salesforce.

## Deployment Models
1. **Public Cloud**: Cloud provider owns everything; multiple customers share resources.
2. **Private Cloud**: Exclusive infrastructure for one organization; high security.
3. **Hybrid Cloud**: Combination of public and private cloud.
4. **Community Cloud**: Shared infrastructure for specific communities with common concerns.
