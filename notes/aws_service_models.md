# AWS Service Models & Deployment Models

## IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
- Provides the basic infrastructure: servers, storage, and networking.
- You manage software, applications, and middleware; the cloud handles the hardware.
- **Example:** Hosting a website on AWS EC2 without owning physical servers.

## PaaS (Platform as a Service)
- Cloud provides the infrastructure and the platform/middleware.
- You provide your application; cloud handles the OS, runtime, and networking.
- **Example:** Deploying a web app on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

## SaaS (Software as a Service)
- Cloud provider manages everything: infrastructure, platform, and application.
- You only use the software; no need to manage anything else.
- **Example:** Gmail, Slack, Salesforce.

1. **Public Cloud:** Shared resources owned by the provider, used by multiple clients.  
2. **Private Cloud:** Dedicated infrastructure for one organization; high security.  
3. **Hybrid Cloud:** Combination of public and private clouds.
